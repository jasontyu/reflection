title: The Idea
---

Every week, write a blog post describing what I learned, and how it's changed my life.

Goal: Reflect on what I've learned and write it down, so I can
- better internalize ideas
- remind myself of important learnings
- practice sharing  my thoughts in a higher leverage way

Success criteria:
- Less than 1 hour required to write and publish each post
- I'm satisfied with the time spent, even if 0 people read it
