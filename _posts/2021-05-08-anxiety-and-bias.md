- What did I learn this week? 
- What do I want to internalize? 
- What will I do differently?

## Anxiety

I like having clear tasks and grinding them out. I dislike uncertainty, because my brain associates it with risk.

When I have a timeline, and then something new pops up that threatens to derail it, then I jump into action-mode, where I feel like I need to respond immediately - whether that's talking to the first person I can think of, estimating how much my timeline will change, or making decisions to accommodate. These are all useful things, but I tend to jump into action immediately, without regard for how much time I actually have to make decisions.

Talking to people requires explaining the situation and why it's important, which forces me to step back and actually consider the urgency. In most cases, I realize that I should be taking more time to learn more, synthesize information, and in many cases do nothing. It's somewhat embarrassing - I should be considering urgency before, not after.

There are some risks that we don't take seriously enough because of the lack of urgency (eg climate change) - the time scale obscures what needs to be done. Internalizing risks that don't feel risky (eg driving) is something I've been working on, and my risk aversion means I tend to be overly-safe. However, most risks in the workplace are not "need to damage-control / divert the trajectory right now" type of risk, if they're even risky or urgent at all. It's not reasonable to treat all uncertainty as time-sensitive, as most uncertainty is benign. 

When I feel anxious, I should listen, but I shouldn't automatically accept it. I should write down "what is at risk" and "how long can I safely delay making a decision." If it's low risk, I can internalize the lack of risk and let my anxiety subside (If it doesn't subside, then there's something that my subconscious is hanging onto, that I need to either accept at the conscious level or cut). If it actually has some risk, then I shouldn't jump into action-mode immediately - in my current life situation, there's hardly anything that requires immediate decision making. To treat the risk seriously is to create mental space for myself to understand the nuances of the situation and what exactly needs to be done.   

Some caveats. In the spirit of the "five minute rule" for tidiness, it's always good to just do it immediately, even if it's not that urgent - it avoids low-urgency things from building up as clutter, crowding out or obscuring larger issues. For immediately life-threatening risks where my fight-or-flight response is actually necessary, preventing myself from acting quickly could be dangerous - it's important to separate out life-threatening risk from the day-to-day "high risk" things like failing a task or letting someone down.

This all goes along with the idea of protecting my time and my energy, both at work and in life. It's already hard enough to enjoy life when nothing is going on. Any non-urgently-actionable "oncall alert" is an opportunity to downgrade it to an "email alert," and every non-actionable "email alert" is an opportunity to tune the alert or remove it completely. 

## Bias as implicit

No one teaches us bias. We learn subconsciously from observation and pattern-matching. Our lived experiences are way more impactful than abstract concepts from education. Even in education, we learn best from storytelling - from living an imagined experience.

So why is it that we try to combat implicit bias with explicit education? Systems like "the golden rule," that make sense in theory but don't quite get used in application. Rosetta moments are the actual gap between the conceptualization of our behavior in abstract, and our behavior in reality. To internalize the existence of Rosetta moments is to understand that the gap must be closed from the side of implicit bias, not from explicit thought.

We must fight fire with fire. On some levels, we know this. The diversity of our social circle is hugely important. 
So how can we create explicit training of implicit bias? Embracing our subconscious defects as the way forward? We must start with identifying the bias we seek to combat. Simply pursuing "diversity" in all its ambiguity means being unable to measure success. From there, we can construct a reversal of the experiences that created this bias in ourselves. If my understanding of fashion and beauty is Euro-centric, created out of my experiences looking at white people in media and online forums, then I can purposefully surround myself with non-white sources of fashion and beauty. To combat problematic perceptions of autistic people, created out of shallow media portrayal and passing experiences, I can follow autistic content creators and read about aspects of their lived experience that I've never seen before.

It seems that I view social media and other digital content as a tool to curate exposure to things that aren't socially or geographically nearby. It's not a replacement, but it is useful. 

Explicit rules and learning is also good. Reading *How to be an Anti-Racist* taught me and helped me internalize ideas that I probably would not have just "figured out"  subconsciously. It still helps to be able to recognize and correct problematic thought patterns. 
## Everything else
### Didn't make the cut
> - career growth - just do what you think is important, don't worry about role boundaries
> - write down perceptions of others

### Ideas that tickle
> - antifragile systems have fragile parts - death for the benefit of the group
> - oncall - reverse engineering vs operational memorization
> - embarrassment as perceived social disapproval of actions, or dissonance with respect to identity.
