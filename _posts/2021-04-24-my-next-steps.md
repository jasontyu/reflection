- What did I learn this week? 
- What do I want to internalize? 
- What will I do differently?

## Networking

I needn't worry about meeting new people when I move to Seattle. I should just continue what I've learned to do in college
- seek out interesting organizations that align with my hobbies/ interests (dance, product, self-learning, well-being, design, etc.)
- reach out to acquaintances and ask them out to lunch
  - schedule activities that we'd both be interested in
  - ask for recommendations "who do I not know that you think I should meet?"
- create groups and spaces that I want to be a part of (eg hotpot nights)

Let's talk more about that last point - creating groups and spaces that I want to be a part of. Clubs can seem so fancy and out of reach, but they're always started by regular people looking to meet and spend time with other people. Consider Journal Club, which is just a bunch of friends agreeing to give each other presentations on a regular basis, or Moonlight, which started out as a bunch of friends dancing together. The barrier to entry is basically nonexistent. Rather than limiting collaboration to 1:1s, why not extend it to more people, creating more value at higher leverage?

Groups and group experiences were the highlight of my college experience - Pearl Hacks, Moonlight, friend groups, club trips.

There are some groups that I can likely find and simply join - dance groups for example, or a local chess club, or even friend groups.

Then there are groups that I may need to create myself. A book club about designing a happier life, or a support group of software engineers interested in becoming PMs, or weekly dim sum outings.

There's also something to be said about creating spaces, distinct from groups. Groups have distinct membership, whereas spaces focus on the activity, and people join and leave the space fluidly. Rather than membership, there's simply attendance. 

The idea of hosting dinner parties is super interesting to me - it's less a club and more like a series of mixers, except rather than two organizations mixing with each other, it'd just be me and my friends mixing with my other friends and acquaintances.

Speaking or teaching a subject is also more like a space than a club. 

#### Next steps
- I should plan to host a dinner party within 30 days of arriving in Seattle - I'll set the date weeks ahead of time, and then figure out the invite list as I go
- I should create a list of people that I know in Seattle, and meet them all in person, one by one
  - in addition to catching up, I should be sure to:
  - ask what groups they're a part of
  - confirm their interests  - what they'd love to see in a group
  - ask for recommendations about who else I should meet
- I should join two organizations, even if it means getting out of my comfort zone.
- Within 90 days, I should start my own group, based on whatever I feel like I'm missing

## Feeling blocked
I still feel blocked about my career, which means that I'm still missing something. I haven't sufficiently convinced myself that I'm doing everything I want to be, which means I either haven't internalized my constraints, or my subconscious still believes that some of my constraints are surmountable. 

It's been about 6 months since I started working full-time - I have yet to receive a formal performance rating, and I have yet to establish a real plan to convert to PM. I tell myself that I must wait and build experience as an engineer first, but I know that lack of experience is not a reasonable barrier (otherwise, how do PMs develop in the first place? Isn't being sharp the #1 factor?). 

I say that I'm interested in doing product work, and I'm slowly finding opportunities to do so at work, but what else am I doing? I haven't been applying and interviewing, I haven't been talking to existing PMs - I've allowed myself to accept my company's and my manager's constraints as my own. 

I know that my company needs more PMs. If my company doesn't feel comfortable taking me on as a PM, that means either
- I'm not yet capable
- I  am capable, but haven't sufficiently proven myself as capable
- I've proven myself as capable, but I haven't converted it into a job change

I believe I'm at #2 - My next step should be to accept the risk on my own and just do it. Identify and fill the gaps that need to be filled, my actual role notwithstanding. The PMs don't know what I can do and don't have the assess me to figure out what I can do. I should just do what I can do, and prove my worth. If it turns out it's not enough, then I will have gained valuable feedback about my gaps, which will also relieve the feeling of being blocked.

#### FROM NOW ON
- Listen to my anxieties. They represent an opportunity, either in changing course, or better internalizing the correctness of my current one.
- If I believe I can be adding more value, just do it. Nobody will stop me from adding value, unless of course it's not actually valuable. Either way, it will be a great outcome. 
(eg creating oncall scenarios)
  - I chose this company for a reason. I should take advantage of the trust around time management, to contribute in the way that seems optimal to me.

## Ideas that tickle
- why curiosity. "Every person I met is my superior in some way. In that, I learn of them."
- "Creativity in business is often nothing more than making the connections that everyone else has almost thought of. You don't have to reinvent the wheel, just attach it to a new wagon" (never eat alone)

- mckinsey case interviews
- rinsing bagels before toasting them
- antifragility vs robustness (antifragile)

# Notes
- More stream of consciousness seems to have helped with writing volume, but it seems more like a personal journal than a public post - I'm not sure if this is the direction I want to go.
