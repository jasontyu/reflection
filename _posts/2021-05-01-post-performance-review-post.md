- What did I learn this week? 
- What do I want to internalize? 
- What will I do differently?
## Prioritization

I like to find opportunities to help. I like identifying problems, and I like it even better when I solve them. However, I've realized that there are too many problems, and thus not all of them are worth my time to solve.

Of the ones that are worth solving, some are not worth solving by me. The most efficient action I can take is often to raise visibility of the issue, to provide feedback and suggestions to the real owner of the problem. If I am affected by a problem, I can take ownership, but it doesn't mean I must do it myself, or play even a major role in its solution. There may be others who are more familiar with the problem or otherwise more suited for its elimination.

## Risk and uncertainty

> - If there is risk, it is often useful to identify opportunities to reduce helplessness

Humans are predictive machines. We worry about the future, avoiding risks and seeking guaranteed gains. Anxiety is an unpleasant byproduct of uncertainty, in a world where privileged people don't objectively have much to worry about. We worry despite lack of risk. We associate uncertainty with risk, and thus overpredict risk.

Worry is only useful when it raises to our attention risk that we wouldn't otherwise have avoided or acted on. However, worry is not free - it distracts us, it releases stress hormones, and it reduces our perceptive well-being - and so we should reduce worry where it's ineffective. Accepting worry at face value is bound to be inefficient - the worry circuits in our brain were not only built for a more primitive environment - they were also built to optimize for reproduction, not subjective well being. Our personal goals for happiness and mental health do not align with that of the brain's software that it came with.

It's usually better to over-worry than under-worry, but it's actually quite hard to under-worry. Or rather, most of our worries are fluff. There are also some things we should probably be worrying about, that we do not - but that is a separate problem.

If something is worthy of worry, then we should seek to reduce helplessness/risk, not uncertainty. Prediction is a fool's game, a fragile approach to life - it works until it doesn't, like the nuclear power plant that was designed for historical risks, not future risks. Instead, we should choose to be more resilient at least - have extra money set aside, or a backup plan - if not antifragile - pivoting during the pandemic. Either way, we reduce risk.

#### FROM NOW ON
> - When feeling anxious, cross examine it's risk + helplessness, not its uncertainty.
> - Shift the burden of proof - don't worry by default, require convincing to worry
> - For that which is convincing, reduce helplessness, take action in order to reduce risk.


## Work life balance
> - fuck work life balance
> - the myth of average
> - balance = enjoyment + satisfaction + purpose
> - balance = novelty + focus

9-5 is a somewhat arbitrary designation. Perhaps it fits some people, but it's unlikely to fit me. I likely prefer less work per day, or maybe more work that is fulfilling, or maybe less monotony. I shouldn't value conforming to a certain # of hours per day. Balance is good, but balance for me must be derived from my own preferences. 

Traditional work life balance implies work as bad but necessary, and so we should minimize it to maximize life, that which is good. 

But for people who find their work satisfying, optimizing this equation becomes less simple. Now, we introduce a different variable - enjoyment vs satisfaction. Being happy vs being satisfied. Enjoying novelty vs purposeful labor.

I don't know what optimal looks like, but I shouldn't assume 9-5 is it. 

#### FROM NOW ON
> - Try overworking. Try underworking. Experiment and take notes and gradient descent.
> - Question constraints that seem to oppose what I might naturally do. Allow myself to learn, even if it means learning the hard way. Something something antifragility.
