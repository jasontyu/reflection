# The idea
Every week, write a blog post describing what I learned, and how it's changed my life.

Goal: Reflect on what I've learned and write it down, so I can
- better internalize ideas
- remind myself of important learnings
- practice sharing  my thoughts in a higher leverage way

Success criteria:
- Less than 1 hour required to write and publish each post
- I'm satisfied with the time spent, even if 0 people read it

# April 03, 2021

- What did I learn this week? 
- What do I want to internalize? 
- What will I do differently?

## Networking
From **never eat alone** by Keith Ferazzi: 
- Ask yourself who you want in your network. Make a plan.
- Follow up. 95% of the people you meet, you never follow up with.
- Be audacious.
- Make it mutually beneficial.

WHY: Weak ties are what makes my network stronger, and it's what keeps life interesting. The diversity of experience will make me a better person, more resilient, and more effective. Networking is the key to success. Cultivating relationships are the key to happiness (see: that lifetime harvard study).

It's easier than I think. People love to feel important and valued, and being DM'd by an acquaintance is a huge ego boost (see: that story of ben franklin borrowing a book).

#### FROM NOW ON:
* Talk regularly to my brother, as a mentorship opportunity and an important personal relationship. 

* Every week, make a list of people I haven't followed up with - acquaintances I wish I knew better,  friends I haven't talked to in a while, coworkers that could help me in the future. Pick 3, brainstorm what to say, and then send it.

* At the end of conversations, ask people "Who else do you think I should meet?"

## Career goal-setting
From my conversation with Hannah (and the lessons of her mom's career), and later the wikipedia page for the *Peter Principle*:
- Re promotions: Pull > Push. 
- If you must push,  you must create your own role to push into.
- Do good work, do what you enjoy, and success will find you.

From the podcast **The Art of Happiness** by Arthur C. Brookes (ep4):
- Work should be the reward
- Choose interesting
- Don't worry about going in a straight line
- Keep passions harmonious, not obsessive

I shouldn't wait for the promotion to do higher value work. Higher level people don't work more, they simply do different work. The only thing stopping an L3 from doing L5 work is capability and managerial guard-rails. I should strive to do the most valuable type of work that I'm capable of. Conveniently, that will probably also be the most interesting work I could find.

Thinking about my goals = less time actually doing things = less learning/fun/progress.


#### FROM NOW ON:
* Stop worrying about optimizing my trajectory. I'm free to discuss my goals with peers and mentors, but I will strive to never discuss it at work, and I will limit the cadence of my personal reflection to bi-annual - per performance review.

* Instead, think about the interesting problems - the ones everyone wishes someone else could solve (or doesn't even understand is a problem). Enjoy the work.

* Don't be limited by traditional expectations of career paths - find the most direct path to where I want to go, even if that requires opening some doors or breaking some walls.

## Happiness
From **The Art of Happiness** ep4:
- faith, family, friends, work that helps others
- uncertainty vs risk, disappointment vs regret (distinguish and resolve)
- satisfaction = wants / haves (make a list, circumscribe)

#### TODO:
* Figure out what my "faith" will look like

* Make a list of wants/haves, and then trim them

## BONUS: Ideas that tickled 
- Creative incompetence (peter principle)
- Judo - grappling a problem into something more doable 
- Stoicism
- The "surprisingly popular" algorithm (literally)
- The Great Filter, anthropic principles, self-replicating spacecraft
- ratemymusic.com

## Notes
- ~Should I write in 1st person or 2nd person? (pronouns, I vs You)~ I'll write to myself
- What should my template look like? What do I want to emphasize in my structure?
- ~How will I publish?~ Thanks for making it easy, Github pages
- Who should I ask to read it?
